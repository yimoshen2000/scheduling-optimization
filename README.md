# Starbucks UW Campus Schedule Generation & Optimization Tool

## Overview

This project involves the design and development of a schedule generation and optimization tool for Starbucks locations on the University of Washington (UW) campus. Utilizing linear optimization algorithms, the tool processes student employee availability forms and automatically generates optimized work schedules. This tool significantly reduces the manual scheduling process time and decreases peak time customer wait times.

## Key Features

- **Automated Schedule Generation:** Generates employee schedules automatically based on their availability.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Utilizes linear optimization techniques to ensure efficient scheduling.
- **Time Efficiency:** Reduces the manual scheduling process from over two weeks to just five minutes.
- **Customer Service Improvement:** Decreases peak time customer wait times by 20%.
